# Plan

## Now

- Add description to commands WIP
- Create docs in thinking format, move this file there
- Replace README with `t help`


## Future

### Could do

- Description how to "install" to vim (Mapping `\c` to `t count` etc.)
- Protect main branch
- Add tests on pull requests
- Setup workflow, for example, [python-package](https://github.com/dudarev/think-cli/new/master?filename=.github%2Fworkflows%2Fpython-package.yml&workflow_template=ci%2Fpython-package)


### New commands

```sh
t random -f filename # random jump to files that are linked from or to filename
t random -i          # take a value from stdin and return a random link from the string
t random -t          # random jump based on time a file was modified with some weight
t rank               # output top pages based on Page rank
t ls -l -i           # list all modified files as links but take stdin and filter links that are already there
```

`:read !python script.py` - This will run the `script.py` script and pass the contents of the current Vim buffer as standard input. The output generated by the script will replace the contents of the current buffer.
